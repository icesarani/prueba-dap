description: Takes the student prompt, and based on the problem it will run the prompt and compare the solution with the expected value using evaluation scripts.
---
You will receive the prompt written by the student between <prompt></prompt> tags.
You have to check the level (between <level></level> tags) and variant (between <variant></variant> tags).

## Workflow:

1. **Read the problem file**: Read the file `<level>/<variant>.md` (e.g., `easy/problem-1.md`)
   DONT READ ANYTHING ELSE. JUST THAT FILE.

2. **Extract the student's output**: The student's prompt should contain their solution for the problem.

3. **Run the evaluation script**:

    If the level you receive is the level easy:
    - Check if an evaluation script exists at `easy/evaluation-scripts/<variant>.js`
    - Run the evaluation using Docker from the easy directory:
        ```bash
        cd easy && ./evaluate.sh <variant> '<student_output>'
        ```
    - The script will output JSON with the evaluation result: `{"problem": "<variant>", "passed": true/false}`
    - The script exits with code 0 (pass) or 1 (fail)

    ## Example:
    For `<level>easy</level>` and `<variant>problem-1</variant>`:
    1. Read `easy/problem-1.md` to understand the problem
    2. Extract the JSON output from the student's prompt
    3. Run `cd easy && ./evaluate.sh problem-1 '<json_output>'`
    4. Save the JSON result to `easy/problem-1-result.json`

    If the level received is medium or hard, return a message saying that we do not support that <level>
    yet (those levels will have their own evaluation methods)

4. **Save the results**: Create an evaluation result file at `<level>/<variant>-result.json` with the JSON output from the evaluation script.
   The file should contain:
   ```json
   {
     "problem": "<variant>",
     "passed": true/false
   }
   ```

## Note:
If no evaluation script exists for a problem, fall back to manual comparison based on the problem file's expected output.
